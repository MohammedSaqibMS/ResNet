# 🧠 Residual Networks with TensorFlow & Keras

This repository demonstrates the implementation of **Residual Networks (ResNets)** using TensorFlow and Keras. ResNets revolutionized deep learning by introducing skip connections, solving the vanishing gradient problem, and enabling the training of very deep neural networks. 🚀
