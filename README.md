## 🛠️ Code Overview

### Identity Block
The identity block is the simplest block in a ResNet. It retains the input dimensions while passing through multiple convolutional layers with a skip connection.  
```python
def identity_block(X, f, filters, stage, block):
    ...
```

### Convolutional Block
The convolutional block differs by having a convolution operation in the shortcut path to match dimensions.  
```python
def convolutional_block(X, f, filters, stage, block, s=2):
    ...
```

### ResNet50 Architecture
Combines convolutional and identity blocks to form the ResNet50 model.  
```python
def ResNet50(input_shape=(64, 64, 3), classes=6):
    ...
```
